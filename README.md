# Deep Learning Homework
## Project Description
In this homework we were asked to create one Jupyter Notebook to build and train an LSTM RNN using cloing prices ("CP") of Bitcoin and one Jupyter Notebook to build and train an LSTM RNN# using Crypto Fear and Greed Index ("FNG"). 

## Conclusions
We were asked to consider the following questions based on the models:

-Which model has a lower loss?

-Which model tracks the actual values better over time?

-Which window size works best for the model?

In evaluating the results, the CP model had a loss of 0.0271 and the FNG model had a loss of 0.1088.  Our model used a mean squared error loss, which has a perfect value of 0.0; therefore, the CP model performed better.

In evaluating the results, the CP model performed much better at predicting the actual values of Bitcoin.

The smaller the window size for the CP and FNG models worked best.
